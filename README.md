## 📄 Functionality

The core functionality revolves around exploring a path from the specified starting value to the target value. The app supports a variety of algorithms, each offering a unique approach to problem-solving. The allowed calculations include addition (+1), subtraction (-1), multiplication (\*2), division (/2), and exponentiation (^2). This ensures flexibility in addressing different scenarios.

## 🪄 Graphical User Interface (GUI)

One of the standout features of this app is its intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI provides a visually appealing representation of the progress made by each algorithm during the search process. Users can observe and analyze the algorithm's steps, gaining insights into its decision-making process.
